# Heatwave-prediction

Heatwave Prediction Model
This project implements a machine learning model to predict heatwaves using a Random Forest classifier. The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset containing weather-related features and performs with perfect accuracy (100%) on the test set, achieving a precision and recall of 1.00 for both classes.

Key Features:
Random Forest Classifier: Utilized to predict the occurrence of heatwaves based on weather-related features.

Performance: The model achieved 100% accuracy on the test set, with precision and recall of 1.00 for both the 'heatwave' and 'no heatwave' classes.

Feature Importance Analysis: Identifies the most influential features in predicting heatwaves.

Cleaned and Raw Datasets: Both the raw and cleaned datasets are included, enabling easy replication and further experimentation.

Next Steps:
Model Validation: Cross-validation or evaluation on other datasets to confirm the model's robustness and generalization.

Feature Engineering: Explore the importance of different features to enhance the model or focus on the most impactful ones.
